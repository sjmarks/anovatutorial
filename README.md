 **STAT 431 project tutorial built with bookdown**
 
 The book provides information about 1-way ANOVA specifically ways to model our data in the context of this statistical method. We introduce the means and effects models and their assumptions and implement these approaches manually in R via matrix algebra. We also discuss power and sample size and provide an interactive visualization to see what influences power in an ANOVA.
